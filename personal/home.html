        <h2>Soul Poem </h2>
        <p>My soul! Your emotions are deeper than the ocean,
            Who will understand your passion?
            For on good days, they are like springs of joy
            that surpass comprehension, impossible to explain,
            as they radiate the essence of life with brilliance.
            But on bad days, they can destroy infinite ecstasy,
            leaving the heart vanished,
            while only the pulsating pain remains,
            embracing the feelings in great agony!</p>

        <h2>Dear Grandma Poem</h2>
        <p>
            Your memories don't fade from my mind,
            and my soul weeps incessantly these days,
            Who would have thought you would leave me?
            That one day I would never hear your voice again...
            But that's how life goes,
            today you're here, and tomorrow is unknown.
            When I learned of your departure,
            I felt for moments that I was fading,
            and my senses didn't recognize,
            that without any objection, you would no longer be with me...
            Now all I have left is to accept,
            what life, by law, gives us.
            It's your death that inspires me to rhyme today,
            and to never forget the time I could love you.
            Dear Grandma, you will always be in my heart...!
