        <h2>Discover the Transformative Power of Words</h2>
        <p>Famous writers have always captivated the world with their literary prowess, leaving an 
          indelible mark on the fabric of human culture. From the timeless works of William Shakespeare 
          to the imaginative realms crafted by J.R.R. Tolkien, their words have resonated across 
          generations, transcending time and space. Ernest Hemingway, known for his succinct yet 
          profound prose, painted vivid landscapes and explored the depths of human emotions. 
          Jane Austen's sharp wit and keen observation of society brought forth beloved characters 
          and social commentary that still ring true today. The visionary mind of George Orwell 
          unveiled dystopian worlds that serve as cautionary tales, warning us of the dangers of 
          totalitarianism. These famous writers and many others have enriched our lives, igniting 
          our imaginations and inviting us into realms both familiar and fantastical, 
          forever cementing their place in the literary pantheon.</p>

        <h2>Oh Captain Poem </h2>
        <p>Oh Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
          The ship has weatherd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
          The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
          While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
          But Oh heart! heart! heart!
          Oh the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
          Fallen cold and dead â€¦</p>
          Walt Whitman Poet</p>

        <h2>I love, you love Poem </h2>
        <p>To love, to love, to love, to love always, with all
          the being and with the earth and with the sky,
          with the brightness of the sun and the darkness of the mud:
          To love with all knowledge and to love with all longing.
          
          And when the mountain of life
          is hard and long and high and full of abysses,
          To love the immensity that is ignited with love
          and to burn in the fusion of our very own </p>
          Ruben Dario Poet</p>
