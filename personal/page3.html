        <h1>Poetry: Who needs it? </h1>        
        <h3> William Logan
          June 14, 2014 </h3>
          <p>
          GAINESVILLE, Fla. — WE live in the age of grace and the age of futility, the age of speed and 
          the age of dullness. The way we live now is not poetic. We live prose, we breathe prose, and 
          we drink, alas, prose. There is prose that does us no great harm, and that may even, in small 
          doses, prove medicinal, the way snake oil cured everything by curing nothing. But to live 
          continually in the natter of ill-written and ill-spoken prose is to become deaf to what language 
          can do.<p>
          
          The dirty secret of poetry is that it is loved by some, loathed by many, and bought by almost no one.
          (Is this the silent majority? Well, once the “silent majority” meant the dead.) We now have a poetry 
          month, and a poet laureate — the latest, Charles Wright, announced just last week — and poetry 
          plastered in buses and subway cars like advertising placards. If the subway line won’t run it, 
          the poet can always tweet it, so long as it’s only 20 words or so. We have all these ways of 
          throwing poetry at the crowd, but the crowd is not composed of people who particularly want to 
          read poetry — or who, having read a little poetry, are likely to buy the latest edition 
          of “Paradise Lost.”<p>
          
          This is not a disaster. Most people are also unlikely to attend the ballet, or an evening with 
          a chamber-music quartet, or the latest exhibition of Georges de La Tour. Poetry has long been 
          a major art with a minor audience. Poets have always found it hard to make a living — at poetry, 
          that is. The exceptions who discovered that a few sonnets could be turned into a bankroll might 
          have made just as much money betting on the South Sea Bubble.<p>
          
          There are still those odd sorts, no doubt disturbed, and unsocial, and torturers of cats, 
          who love poetry nevertheless. They come in ones or twos to the difficult monologues of Browning, 
          or the shadowy quatrains of Emily Dickinson, or the awful but cheerful poems of Elizabeth Bishop, 
          finding something there not in the novel or the pop song.<p>

          Poetry was long ago shoved aside in schools. In colleges its often easier to find courses on race or 
          class or gender than on the Augustans or Romantics. In high schools and grade schools, when poetry 
          is taught at all, too often its as a shudder of self-expression, without any attempt to look at the 
          difficulties and majesties of verse and the subtleties of meaning that make poetry poetry. No wonder 
          kids dont like it — it becomes another way to bully them into feeling “compassion” or “tolerance,” 
          part of a curriculum that makes them good citizens but bad readers of poetry.<p>

          My blue-sky proposal: teach Americas kids to read by making them read poetry. Shakespeare and Pope 
          and Milton by the fifth grade; in high school, Dante and Catullus in the original. By graduation, 
          they would know Anne Carson and Derek Walcott by heart. A child taught to parse a sentence by 
          Dickinson would have no trouble understanding Donald H. Rumsfelds known knowns and unknown unknowns.<p>

          We dont live in such a world, and perhaps not even poets alive today wish we did. 
          My ideal elementary-school curriculum would instead require all children to learn: (1) the times 
          tables up to, say, 25; (2) a foreign language, preferably obscure; (3) the geography of a foreign 
          land, like New Jersey; (4) how to use basic hand tools and cook a cassoulet; (5) how to raise a bird 
          or lizard (if the child is vegetarian, then a potato); (6) poems by heart, say one per week; (7) 
          how to find the way home from a town at least 10 miles away; (8) singing; (9) somersaults. With all 
          that out of the way by age 12, theres no telling what children might do. I have thieved a couple 
          of items from W. H. Audens dream curriculum for a College of Bards. If my elementary school students 
          are not completely disgusted by poetry, off they could go one day to that college, well prepared.</p>
